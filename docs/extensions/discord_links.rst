Discord Links Extension
=======================

Overview
--------

Discord has become the de facto standard for clan communication. One of the challenges in working with Discord bots and Clash of Clans is linking a Clash of Clans village to a Discord account.  Thanks to a new API originally created by ReverendMike, now taken over by TubaKid, this problem is now solved.  coc.py leverages this API to allow bot developers easy access to linked accounts.


The coc.py extension for Discord links allows you to do the following:

- Link a Discord account to one or more player tags
- Update existing links
- Remove links
- Get player tag(s) based on a Discord ID
- Get a Discord ID based on a player tag
- Get a list of Discord IDs based on an iterable of player tags

In order to use the Discord Links API, you will need a username and password.
Please contact TubaKid#8822 on Discord if you are interested.
