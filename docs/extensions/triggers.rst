Triggers Extension
=======================

Overview
--------

coc.py's events are an extremely powerful framework, but they are not particularly well suited for periodic bulk-update
style tasks, and employing the use of ``APScheduler`` or similar modules feels excessive for such a simple job. That is
where the triggers extension for coc.py comes into play.

This extension provides you with powerful and easy to use decorators that turn your coroutines into periodically
repeating tasks without the need for any additional modifications. It is as simple as putting a trigger decorator on
your existing coroutine functions. The triggers extension comes with:

- two types of triggers: ``IntervalTrigger``  and ``CronTrigger``,
- customisable error handlers for each trigger and a global ``@on_error()`` fallback handler,
- extensive logging that can seamlessly be integrated with your existing logger,
- integrated tools to apply your repeating function across an iterable, and
- a framework that is easy to extend, allowing you to create your own custom triggers if you need to.

API Reference
-------------

IntervalTrigger
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :class:`IntervalTrigger` will continuously loop the decorated function, sleeping for a defined number of seconds
between executions. For convenience, this trigger defines ``.hourly()``  and ``.daily()`` class methods to instantiate
triggers with a sleep time of 1 hour and 24 hours, respectively.

.. autoclass:: coc.ext.triggers.IntervalTrigger
   :members: hourly, daily

CronTrigger
~~~~~~~~~~~

The :class:`CronTrigger` allows you to specify a standard dialect Cron schedule string to dictate the trigger's
executions. This allows you to specify highly specialised schedules to e.g. fetch clan game points before and after
the clan games, legend league rankings before and after season reset and much more. For convenience, a set of class
methods to instantiate triggers with common patters have been provided:

- ``hourly()`` implements the ``0 * * * *`` schedule,

- ``daily()`` implements ``0 0 * * *``,

- ``weekly()`` implements ``0 0 * * 0``, and

- ``monthly()`` implements ``0 0 1 * *``.


.. autoclass:: coc.ext.triggers.CronTrigger
   :members: hourly, daily, weekly, monthly

.. _Starting the Triggers:

Starting the Triggers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, triggers don't start on their own. This is because you typically want to load other resources before
running a trigger, e.g. log in to the coc dev site, start your Discord bot or boot up a database connection. If a
trigger fired right away, the initial runs would likely fail due to unavailability of these resources. Due to how
Python works, a trigger would run the moment the interpreter reaches the definition, usually well before you intend
to actually start (you can see that illustrated in the examples as well). That is why by default, all triggers are
set to ``autostart=False``.

The triggers extension provides a :meth:`coc.ext.triggers.start_triggers()` function to manually kick off trigger
execution from within your code once you're ready to start processing. If you don't need any additional resources to
load in first or have otherwise made sure that your triggers won't fire early, you can set them to ``autostart=True``
and omit the call to :meth:`coc.ext.triggers.start_triggers()`. If you have a mixture of auto-started and not
auto-started triggers, :meth:`coc.ext.triggers.start_triggers()` will only start the ones that aren't already running.

.. autofunction:: coc.ext.triggers.start_triggers

Error Handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The triggers extension offers two ways to deal with error handling:

- passing a handler function directly to the trigger's ``error_handler`` parameter. This allows you to specify
  individual error handlers for each repeated task if you need to.
- designating a global error handler by decorating a function with ``coc.ext.triggers.on_error()``. This will be used
  as a fallback by all triggers that don't have a dedicated error handler passed to them during initialisation.

.. autofunction:: coc.ext.triggers.on_error

An error handler function must be defined with ``async def`` and accept three parameters in the following order:

- a function_name string. The name of the failing trigger's decorated function will be passed to this parameter.
- an arg of arbitrary type (defined by what is passed to the trigger's iter_args parameter). The failing element of
  the trigger's iter_args will be passed to this argument, if any are defined. Otherwise, this parameter will receive
  ``None``.
- an exception. This parameter will be passed the exception that occurred during the execution of the trigger.

Additional arguments can statically be passed to the error handler making use of ``functools.partial``, if needed.

Logging
~~~~~~~

Each trigger can be provided with a class implementing the ``logging.Logger`` functionality. If set, the logger will
receive the following events:

- **info**: trigger execution starts and finishes, along with the next scheduled run times.
- **warning**: if a trigger missed it's next scheduled run time.
- **error**: if an exception occurs during the execution of a trigger. If both a logger and an error handler are set
  up, both will receive information about this event.

Other Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similar to the events API, triggers allow you to specify a list of elements you want the decorated function to be
spread over. If you specify the ``iter_args`` parameter when initialising a trigger, it will call the decorated
function once for each element of that parameter. Each element will be positionally passed into the function's first
argument. If you prefer to keep your logic inside the function or load it from somewhere else, simply don't pass the
``iter_args`` parameter. That will let the trigger know not to inject any positional args.

The boolean ``on_startup`` flag allows you to control the trigger behaviour on startup. If it is set to ``True``, the
trigger will fire immediately and resume its predefined schedule afterwards. If ``on_startup`` is ``False``, the
trigger will remain dormant until its first scheduled run time.

The ``autostart`` option allows you to decide whether a trigger should automatically start on application startup.
If autostart is disabled, triggers can be started using :meth:`coc.ext.triggers.start_triggers()` once all
dependencies and required resources are loaded. Refer to `Starting the Triggers`_ for details.

The ``loop`` parameter allows you to pass your own asyncio event loop to attach the trigger execution to. If omitted,
the current event loop will be used.

You can also specify additional key word arguments (``**kwargs``). Any extra arguments will be passed to the decorated
function as key word arguments on each call.

Extending this Extension
------------------------

If you find yourself in need of scheduling logic that none of the included triggers can provide, you can easily
create a trigger class that fits your needs by importing the :class:`BaseTrigger` from this extension, creating a
subclass and overwriting the ``next_run``  property. The property needs to return a *timezone-aware*
``datetime.datetime`` object indicating when the trigger should run next based on the current system time.


.. code-block:: python3

   from coc.ext.triggers import BaseTrigger
   from datetime import datetime, timedelta
   from random import randint

   class RandomTrigger(BaseTrigger):
       def __init__(self,
                    *,  # disable positional arguments
                    seconds: int,
                    iter_args: Optional[list] = None,
                    on_startup: bool = True,
                    autostart: bool = False,
                    error_handler: Optional[CoroFunction] = None,
                    logger: Optional[logging.Logger] = None,
                    loop: Optional[asyncio.AbstractEventLoop] = None,
                    **kwargs):

           super().__init__(iter_args=iter_args, on_startup=on_startup, autostart=autostart,
                            error_handler=error_handler, logger=logger, loop=loop, **kwargs)

       @property
       def next_run(self) -> datetime:
           """randomly triggers every 50-100 seconds"""
           return datetime.now().astimezone() + timedelta(seconds=randint(50, 101))
