Easy to use asynchronous Clash of Clans API wrapper in Python.

Key Features
-------------
- Asynchronous code
- Entire coverage of the official Clash of Clans API
- Email/password login removes the stress of managing tokens
- Optimised for speed, memory and performance

Getting Started
================

Installing
-----------
**Python 3.7 or higher is required**

.. code:: sh

    # Linux/macOS
    python3 -m pip install -U coc.py

    # Windows
    py -3 -m pip install -U coc.py

    # to install the development version:
    python3 -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/mathsman5133/coc.py


Quick Example
--------------
This is the basic usage of the library.
This example will get a player with a certain tag, and search for 5 clans with a name.

.. code:: py

    import asyncio
    import coc


    async def main():
        async with coc.Client() as coc_client:
            try:
                await coc_client.login("email", "password")
            except coc.invalidcredentials as error:
                exit(error)

            player = await client.get_player("tag")
            print(f"{player.name} has {player.trophies} trophies!")

            clans = await client.search_clans(name="best clan ever", limit=5)
            for clan in clans:
                print(f"{clan.name} ({clan.tag}) has {clan.member_count} members")

            try:
                war = await client.get_current_war("#clantag")
                print(f"{war.clan_tag} is currently in {war.state} state.")
            except coc.privatewarlog:
                print("uh oh, they have a private war log!")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        try:
            asyncio.run(main())
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            pass

Basic Events Example
---------------------
This script will run forever, printing to the terminal
whenever someone joins the clan or a member of the clan donates troops.

.. code:: py

    import asyncio
    import logging

    import coc


    @coc.ClanEvents.member_join()
    async def foo(player, clan):
        print(f"{player.name} ({player.tag}) just joined {clan.name} ({clan.tag})")


    @coc.ClanEvents.member_donations()
    async def bar(old_member, member):
        troops_donated = member.donations - old_member.donations
        print(f"{member.name} just donated {troops_donated} troops!")


    async def main():
        coc_client = coc.EVentsClient()
        try:
            await coc.login("email", "password")
        except coc.InvalidCredentials as error:
            exit(error)

        # Register all the clans you want to monitor
        list_of_clan_tags = ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
        coc_client.add_clan_updates(*list_of_clan_tags)

        # Register the callbacks for each of the events you are monitoring
        coc_client.add_events(
            foo,
            bar
        )


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
        log = logging.getLogger()

        loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
        try:
            loop.run_until_complete(main())
            loop.run_forever()
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            pass
